Submission for MATH F243 Assignment 1.

C algorithm that uses backtracking to return an adjacency preserving grid. It's hardcoded to level 4, but is modifiable to any level with strictly rectangular nodes, and no need for rotation.

Will try to implement rotational function and support for irregular shapes in the future.

To run : enter this command in the terminal :

```./bt 12 12 21 12 21 12``` 

(The command line arguements represent the block dimensions.)
